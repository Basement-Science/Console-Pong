# Console-Pong
A quick C# dotnet 5 implementation of Pong that runs in the Terminal. 

## Features
- for 2-Players, unless you want to play against yourself
- Responsive control using Keyboard
- twist: Ball has a chance to split when hit
- highly threaded
- Unicode characters for Graphics
- Windows only (due to Keyboard implementation)

I wrote this over the course of 2 days after having a look at someone else's implementation - that I wasn't happy with. üòè

This could be a good basis if you want to modify it yourself.

## Known Issues
- resizing the console breaks everything
- minimum console size required
